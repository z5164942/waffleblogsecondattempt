<p>My initial goal in writing the <em>slum</em> theme was purely selfish: I use blogdown on <a href="https://djnavarro.net">my own blog</a> and I wanted to understand how it works. To help me learn, I decided to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">read the documentation</a> and tinker with the minimalistic <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">XMin theme</a>. I… um… got a little carried away, and ended up with a fairly flexible blogging template with a few more bells and whistles than I was expecting. I wasn’t entirely convinced it would be useful, so I named it <em>Somewhat-Light Unhelpfully-Minimal</em> Hugo theme.</p>
<p>Having created the thing, I decided I might as well document it too…</p>
<p>My assumption is that anyone intending to use the <em>slum</em> theme is using it within blogdown rather than some other kind of <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> website, so the documentation is written with an R user in mind. Additionally, I’ll assume that you’ve never used blogdown or Hugo before, but I do assume you’ve used <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a slumdown blog</h2>
<p>The <em>slumdown</em> package is an experiment in creating a simple “blogdown native” Hugo theme, one that assumes that posts are written using R Markdown. It extends the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-slum">slum theme for Hugo</a> by providing an interface for customising the blog within R and a system for generating plots that use the same colour scheme as the blog post. The <em>slumdown</em> package is not on CRAN and so needs to be installed from GitHub:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># devtools::install_github(&quot;djnavarro/slumdown&quot;)
library(&quot;slumdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>By default, the <em>slumdown</em> package assumes the source code for the site takes the form of an RStudio project, and will be deployed to GitHub pages, though neither is strictly necessary. To get started:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slum_new(dir = &quot;path/to/my/slumblog&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>This will create a new RStudio project called <code>slumblog</code> (or whatever), download the slum theme and the example site. From within the project, initialise the blog using <code>blogdown</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::serve_site()</code></pre>
<p>Blogdown will then generate the <a href="https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/">example site</a> in the <code>docs</code> folder, which provides a short tutorial on how to get started using the package and what it is capable of.</p>

<div id="initial-configuration" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial configuration</h2>
<p>Most of the settings that you’ll initially want to play with are in the <code>config.toml</code> file. The file is (I hope) fairly well documented, so you can see what most of the settings do and how to configure them. For example, here’s
a snippet:</p>
<pre><code># These settings specify the title for your blog, 
# and the name of the Hugo theme that it uses.
title = &quot;A minimal Hugo website&quot;
theme = &quot;hugo-slum&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at the config file, change a couple of things if you like, and then you’re ready to start blogging!</p>
