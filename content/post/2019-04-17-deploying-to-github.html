summary: "This tutorial describes how to deploy a site. Blogdown sites are very often deployed to Netlify, but I have a personal bias to use GitHub Pages, so *slumdown* is configured by default to use GitHub."

<p>The usual advice for deploying a blogdown site is to deploy to Netlify rather than GitHub Pages, because there are a few peculiarities with GitHub Pages that make this difficult. However, I have an ingrained habit of using GitHub Pages, with each repository hosted at</p>
<pre><code>https://username.github.io/reponame/</code></pre>
<p>To make that happen for a blogdown site there are three things you need to change from the usual defaults:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, the site needs to be generated in the <code>docs</code> folder (which is what GitHub Pages expects) rather than the Hugo default which is to generate the site in the <code>public</code> folder. You can configure this by including the following line in the <code>config.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>publishDir = &quot;docs&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This line is already included in the example site for <em>slumdown</em> – i.e., this one – so if you’ve started by installing this site then this has already been done for you.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, the generated <code>docs</code> folder needs to contain a blank text file called <code>.nojekyll</code>, otherwise GitHub Pages will try to treat your content as a Jekyll blog and it won’t deploy correctly. The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the <code>.nojekyll</code> file is in the <code>static</code> folder, which will ensure that every time blogdown re-generates the <code>docs</code> folder the <code>.nojekyll</code> file will be copied across with it. If you installed the site using <code>slumdown::slum_new()</code> this will have been done for you automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, if you want the site to be hosted at a specific location (i.e., <code>https://username.github.io/reponame/</code> rather than <code>https://username.github.io/</code>), Hugo needs to know what <code>reponame</code> is, otherwise the paths to various files will break when the site deploys. To do this, there is a line in the <code>config.toml</code> file that (by default) reads as follows:</p>
<pre><code>baseurl = &quot;/hugo-slum/&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Edit this to replace <code>hugo-slum</code> with <code>reponame</code> (or whatever you called your repository)</p>
<p>From there, set up your <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> site the way you normally would. <strong>TODO</strong>: Add a quick primer on GitHub Pages.</p>
