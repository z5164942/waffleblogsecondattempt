<h1>The idea behind <em>slumdown</em></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-slum">slum theme for Hugo</a> and blogdown is an adaptation Yihue Xie’s <em>Xmin</em> theme that borrows stylistic elements from the <em>Tufte</em> R Markdown theme and from the <em>academic</em> Hugo theme. Originally it was intended to be extremely minimal, with the very modest goal of trying to make sure I understood the logic of how Hugo generates static sites. The more I played with it though, the more I enjoyed it. So what I ended up with is a <em>“Somewhat-Light Unhelpfully-Minimal”</em> Hugo theme that I’m intending to use on <a href="https://djnavarro.net">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>As it developed, I started getting annoyed at the fact that Hugo themes don’t make their colour schemes easily accessible, which means it’s hard to generate plots in R that match the visual style of the blog. So I decided to adapt the <em>slum</em> theme so that the colour templates were easily accessible, and wrote the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/slumdown">slumdown package</a> so that I’d have a convenient user interface.</p>
<p>All in all, this has been a fun excercise, and I’ve learned quite a bit about Hugo, blogdown, and CSS in the process. I’m definitely keen on the idea of developing “blogdown aware” Hugo themes like <em>slum</em> alongside R packages like <em>slumdown</em> that take advantage of this.</p>
